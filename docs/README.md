# Flashbots Recovery System Documentation

## Overview

The Flashbots Recovery System is a sophisticated MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) protection and token recovery system designed to protect compromised wallets from attackers while enabling legitimate token recovery operations. The system uses Flashbots bundles to execute atomic transactions that either front-run malicious activities or recover tokens in coordination with upgrade transactions.

## Quick Start

1. **Environment Setup**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure all required variables
2. **Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. **Configuration**: Ensure all addresses and keys are properly configured
4. **Execution**: Run `npm run start` to begin monitoring and recovery operations

## System Requirements

- Node.js 18+ with TypeScript support
- Access to Ethereum RPC endpoints (mainnet/testnet)
- Flashbots relay access
- Alchemy API key for enhanced monitoring
- Properly configured wallet keys and contract addresses

## Security Notice

⚠️ **CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING** ⚠️

This system handles private keys and performs financial transactions. Ensure:
- Private keys are securely stored and never committed to version control
- All RPC endpoints are trusted and secure
- The compromised wallet truly requires recovery
- All contract addresses are verified and correct
- Test thoroughly on testnets before mainnet deployment
